# Hacktonauts-Dataset
The trained weights for the custom dataset trained on the Stable Diffusion pipeline are available to test at: https://huggingface.co/aakashrajaraman/output. This is the version 1.0, trained on just a small sample of data, and am abstract instance and class prompt set. 

For the future scope, the pipeline will use a latest version of Stable Diffusion, and additional hyperparameter tuning.
